Next recommended movable-to-C components:
- Database CRUD (complaint create/read/update/delete)
- File metadata handling (store file name, path)
- Simple analytics (counts, status counts)
- Any CPU-bound processing (audio processing, if present)
- Validation can stay in Flask (easier) or moved to C for performance

I will now:
1) Inspect the original app.py and adapt its routes in the scaffold to call into the C library where appropriate.
2) Add additional C functions (list complaints, get complaint by id, update status) and expose them.
3) Build updated scaffold zip ready for Render.
